	Abstract = {For many supervised learning tasks it may be infeasible (or very expensive) to obtain objective and reliable labels. Instead, we can collect subjective (possibly noisy) labels from multiple experts or annotators. In practice, there is a substantial amount of disagreement among the annotators, and hence it is of great practical interest to address conventional supervised learning problems in this scenario. In this paper we describe a probabilistic approach for supervised learning when we have multiple annotators providing (possibly noisy) labels but no absolute gold standard. The proposed algorithm evaluates the different experts and also gives an estimate of the actual hidden labels. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is superior to the commonly used majority voting baseline.},

@article{Mariooryad2015,
	Abstract = {An appealing scheme to characterize expressive behaviors is the use of emotional dimensions such as activation (calm versus active) and valence (negative versus positive). These descriptors offer many advantages to describe the wide spectrum of emotions. Due to the continuous nature of fast-changing expressive vocal and gestural behaviors, it is desirable to continuously track these emotional traces, capturing subtle and localized events (e.g., with FEELTRACE). However, time-continuous annotations introduce challenges that affect the reliability of the labels. In particular, an important issue is the evaluators' reaction lag caused by observing, appraising, and responding to the expressive behaviors. An empirical analysis demonstrates that this delay varies from 1 to 6 seconds, depending on the annotator, expressive dimension, and actual behaviors. Our experiments show accuracy improvements even with fixed delays (1-3 seconds). This paper proposes to compensate for this reaction lag by finding the time-shift that maximizes the mutual information between the expressive behaviors and the time-continuous annotations. The approach is implemented by making different assumptions about the evaluators' reaction lag. The benefits of compensating for the delay is demonstrated with emotion classification experiments. On average, the classifiers trained with facial and speech features show more than 7 percent relative improvements over baseline classifiers trained and tested without shifting the time-continuous annotations.},

@article{Lakshminarayanan2013,
	Abstract = {A popular approach for large scale data annotation tasks is crowdsourcing, wherein each data point is labeled by multiple noisy annotators. We consider the problem of inferring ground truth from noisy ordinal labels obtained from multiple annotators of varying and unknown expertise levels. Annotation models for ordinal data have been proposed mostly as extensions of their binary/categorical counterparts and have received little attention in the crowdsourcing literature. We propose a new model for crowdsourced ordinal data that accounts for instance difficulty as well as annotator expertise, and derive a variational Bayesian inference algorithm for parameter estimation. We analyze the ordinal extensions of several state-of-the-art annotator models for binary/categorical labels and evaluate the performance of all the models on two real world datasets containing ordinal query-URL relevance scores, collected through Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Our results indicate that the proposed model performs better or as well as existing state-of-the-art methods and is more resistant to `spammy' annotators (i.e., annotators who assign labels randomly without actually looking at the instance) than popular baselines such as mean, median, and majority vote which do not account for annotator expertise.},
